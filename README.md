An OpenCV face detection project typically involves using the OpenCV library,
a popular computer vision library, to detect human faces in images or video streams.
This project often utilizes techniques such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately locate and identify faces within the input data.
The project might include steps such as preprocessing the images, applying the face detection algorithm, and then potentially performing further analysis or tasks based on the detected faces, 
such as facial recognition, emotion detection, or face tracking.
It's a fascinating application of computer vision technology with numerous practical uses, from security systems to photo editing apps.
